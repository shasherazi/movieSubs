# Movie Subtitles

This app empowers deaf and hard-of-hearing users, as well as anyone who needs accessible subtitles, to load external SRT subtitle files and display them in a large, readable, and visually appealing format inspired by Spotify's lyrics view. Designed for real-time movie captioning in cinemas where closed captions are not available, this app enhances accessibility and inclusivity, making the movie-going experience enjoyable for everyone.

## How to Use

Download the app from the [Releases](https://github.com/shasherazi/movieSubs/releases) page. The app is only available for Android devices because I don't own an Apple device (open PR for iOS development).

After downloading and installing the app, follow these steps:

1. Download the SRT subtitle file for the movie you want to watch.
2. Open the app and select the SRT file from your device.
