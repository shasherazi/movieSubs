# Movie Subtitles

This app enables users to load external SRT subtitle files and display them in a large, readable, and stylish format, similar to Spotify's lyrics view. The main goal is to provide real-time captions for movies in cinemas where closed captions are not available, making the movie-going experience more accessible.

## How to Use

Download the app from the [Releases](https://github.com/shasherazi/movieSubs/releases/tag/v1.0.0) page. The app is only available for Android devices because I don't own an Apple device (open PR for iOS development).

After downloading and installing the app, follow these steps:

1. Download the SRT subtitle file for the movie you want to watch.
2. Open the app and select the SRT file from your device.
